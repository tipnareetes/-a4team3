    <h1>Personal Information Protection in Mobile Apps</h1>
    
    <h2>Are You At Risk? Yes, You Are!</h2>
    
    <img src="gitimage/pip.jpg" alt="PIP"> 
    
   <p>Personal Information Protection (P.I.P) is something that we should all be informed about. In our modern society, the use of online data storage has become more fundamental in our daily lives, and our personal information is used and shared on a regular basis.</p>
     
    
  
        
    <h3 style="font-size:18px">How is P.I.P permitted and collected?</h3>
        <p>Statistics show that we are using our mobile devices more than our desktops and laptops by 57%. More and more things can be done using our cellular phones with mobile apps, such as online banking, map services, online dating and business tools, to name a few. When we are using mobile apps, it usually prompts for permission on information storage, sharing, and diverse access, depending on the purpose of the app, and is thus collected.

        </p>    
   
        <h3>What is the point?</h3>
        <p>Some apps don’t collect financial or credit card data, and while many developers don’t believe their apps are worth hacking, many hackers are after information such as passwords, consumer data, email addresses, company data, etc. The extent of reasons for mobile app hacking is beyond just criminal and people seeking to experiment. Corporations and governments hack into our apps to access user data, potential market demographics, and even to aid criminal prosecutions for the case of government entities. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>How insecure are mobile apps?</h3>
        <p>Anyone has the liberty to create and publish apps, but both Android and IOS can have security loopholes that makes hacking possible with ease. 75% of mobile apps fail even basic security tests, 96% of Google Play’s top free games can be reverse-engineered, 85% of the top 200 free Android apps can be decompiled, and 97% of all apps have no binary protection. </p>
        
        <h3>The statistics between O.S.’s</h3>
        <p>High-risk vulnerabilities were found in 38% of mobile applications for iOS and in 43% of Android applications. Most cases are caused by weaknesses in security mechanisms (74% and 57% for iOS and Android apps, respectively, and 42% for server-side components). 60% of vulnerabilities are on the client-side, 89% of vulnerabilities can be exploited without physical access, and 56% of vulnerabilities can be exploited without administrator rights (jailbreak or root).</p>
        
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>All mobile apps are vulnerable. Jailbreak or root privileges are file systems that give full access. According to researchers' data [1], 8 percent of iOS users have jailbroken their devices and 27 percent of Android devices are running with root privileges. In 2015, there was a malware “KeyRaider” that stole over 225,000 apple accounts to create free apputopia [2]. I.T.C. Insecure interprocess communication, remote access data processed in a vulnerable mobile application. IPC is generally forbidden in IOS. However, it can be used in alternative ways via URL and app extension. Server-side components contain vulnerabilities both in application code and in the app protection mechanisms. </p>
